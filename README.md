# SImonSaysPiBadCode
awfully written code

# How to wire:
  pin 39 - ground for score (green LEDs)
  
  pins 37, 35, 40, 31, 29 - GPIO for score LEDs in that order of turning on
  
  pin 34 - ground for fail (red) and complete (yellow) LEDs
  
  pin 36 - GPIO for complete LED
  
  pin 38 - GPIO for fail LED
